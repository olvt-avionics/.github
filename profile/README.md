Started by a group of ten passionate individuals in the spring of 2016, we are a group of dedicated Virginia Tech students with the long term goal of becoming the first collegiate organization to deliver an object into Low Earth Orbit. OLVT is comprised of students with expertise in avionics, structural design, propulsion systems, launch safety, trajectory analysis, and business. We are proud to have the support of the Kevin T. Crofton Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering as well as the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, and hope to bring other colleges on board in the near future. Today, the team has over one hundred members studying across multiple departments and colleges at Virginia Tech. We are humbled by the diversity of the areas in which our members study, and are dedicated to providing them with the best hands-on career-oriented experience they can find on campus.
